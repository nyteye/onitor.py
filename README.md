Server Performance Monitor & Alert System | Python, Linux, Shell Scripting

Developed a robust system monitoring tool using Python (psutil) to track real-time server metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network Traffic) across Linux environments.

Implemented automated incident detection logic that triggers alerts when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., >80% CPU), reducing potential downtime risks.

Engineered a logging mechanism to capture historical performance data, enabling root cause analysis and proactive capacity planning.

Simulated enterprise-level workflows by integrating email notification scripts, demonstrating proficiency in operational automation and Python scripting.
